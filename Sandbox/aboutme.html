                <p class="about-me-paragraph">Hey, my name is Caleb. I'm a Front End Developer from Owensboro, Kentucky.</p>
                <p class="about-me-paragraph">After graduating from Vanderbilt University in 2016, I worked as a freelance writer and economics tutor for six years. Over time I started to crave a more fulfilling career path, which led me to web development. I primarily work with with vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. However, as my projects show, I am quick to adapt to libraries and frameworks, and I have exposure to Vue, React, and Bootstrap.  </p>
